<br/>
</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> install a backup tool like `snapper` or `timeshift`. and Backup your system before installing hyprland using this script. This script does NOT include uninstallation of packages

> [!NOTE]
> Main reason why I have not included an uninstallation script is simple. Some packages maybe already installed on your system by default. If I create an uninstall script with packages that I have set to install, you may end up a unrecoverable system. 

> [!WARNING] 
> Download this script on a directory where you have write permissions. ie. HOME. Or any directory within your home directory. Else script will fail

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-requisites and VERY Important! ### 
- Do not run this installer as sudo or as root
- This Installer requires a user with a priviledge to install packages
- This is only tested on 24.04 LTS. Older Ubuntu wont work
- If you have login Manager already like GDM (gnome login manager), I highly advice not to install SDDM. But if you decide to install SDDM, see here [`Issue 2 - SDDM`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Debian-Hyprland/issues/2)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using Gnome already, DO NOT install the SDDM. The GDM Login Manager works well with Hyprland. For some reason, during installation, you will be asked which login manager you wanted to use. But during my test, nothing happened.

> [!CAUTION] 
> For Ubuntu with NVIDIA GPU's, make sure to edit the install-scripts/nvidia.sh . Delete all packages in nvidia_pkg except libva-wayland2 and nvidia-vaapi-driver and uncomment/remove # before sudo ubuntu-drivers install. You also need to delete or simply just add # in the lines 37 and 38  echo "echo "## for nvidia" | sudo tee -a... and echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian........

> [!WARNING] 
> If you have GDM already as log-in manager, DO NOT install SDDM
> You will encounter issues. See [`Issue 2 - SDDM`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Debian-Hyprland/issues/2)

#### ‚ú®  Some notes on this installer / Prerequisites
- This script is meant to install in Debian Testing (Trixie). 
- If However, decided to try, recommend to install SDDM. Apart from GDM and SDDM, any other Login Manager may not work nor launch Hyprland. However, hyprland can be launched through tty by type Hyprland
- üïØÔ∏è network-manager-gnome (nm-applet) has been removed from the packages to install. This is because it is known to restart the networkmanager causing issues in the installation process. After you boot up, inorder to get the network-manager applet, install network-manager-gnome. `sudo apt install network-manager-gnome` See below if your network or wifi became unmanaged after installation
- If you have nvidia, and wanted to use proprietary drivers, uninstall nouveau first (if installed). This script will be installing proprietary nvidia drivers and will not deal with removal of nouveau.
- NVIDIA users / owners, after installation, check [`THIS`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/Notes_to_remember#--for-nvidia-gpu-users)
 
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING! nwg-look takes long time to install. 
- nwg-look is a utility to costumize your GTK theme. It's a LXAppearance like. Its a good tool though but this package is entirely optional

#### ‚ú® Costumize the packages to be installed
- inside the install-scripts folder, you can edit 00-hypr-pkgs.sh. Do not edit 00-dependencies.sh unless you know what you are doing. Care though as the Hyprland Dots may not work properly!
- default GTK theme if agreed to be installed is Tokyo night GTK themes (dark and light) + Tokyo night SE icons

#### üîî NOTICE TO NVIDIA OWNERS ### 
- by default it is installing the latest and newest nvidia drivers. If you have an older nvidia-gpu (GTX 800 series and older), check out nvidia-debian website [`LINK`](https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers) and edit nvidia.sh in install-scripts folder to install proper gpu driver
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to use nouveau driver, choose N when asked if you have nvidia gpu. This is because the nvidia installer part, it will blacklist nouveau. Hyprland will still be installed but it will skip blacklisting nouveau.

#### ü§¨ FAQ
#### Most common question I got is, Hey Ja, Why the heck it is taking long time to install? Other distro like Arch its only a minute or two. Why here takes like forever?!?!?!
- Well, most of the core packages are downloaded and Build and compiled from SOURCE. There are no pre-built binary (yet) for Debian and Ubuntu. Unlike Other distros, they already have prepacked binary that can just download and install.

> [!NOTE] 
> This script does not setup audio. Kindly set up. If you have not, I recommend pipewire. `sudo apt install -y pipewire`

#### ‚ùó some known issues on this Installer
- some users reported that they have to install some packages. It is in the install-scripts/force-install.sh
- At this time the packages force to install are the following `imagemagick`

#### üîß Proper way to re-installing a particular script from install-scripts folder
- CD into Debian-Hyprland Folder and then ran the below command. 
- i.e. `./install-scripts/gtk-themes` - For reinstall GTK Themes. 

#### üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap:
- [ ] possibly adding gruvbox themes, cursors, icons

#### ‚ùó some known issues for nvidia
- reports from members of my discord, states that some users of nvidia are getting stuck on sddm login. credit  to @Kenni Fix stated was 
```  
 while in sddm press ctrl+alt+F2 or F3
log into your account
`lspci -nn`, find the id of your nvidia card
`ls /dev/dri/by-path` find the matching id
`ls -l /dev/dri/by-path` to check where the symlink points to 
)
```
- add "env = WLR_DRM_DEVICES,/dev/dri/cardX" to the ENVvariables config (.config/hypr/UserConfigs/ENVariables.conf)  ; X being where the symlink of the gpu points to
